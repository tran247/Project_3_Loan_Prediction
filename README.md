Loan Prediction: https://www.kaggle.com/ninzaami/loan-predication

Background:
We will be looking at home loan application data. The challenge of this data set is to automate the loan eligibility process as the customer puts in their information. They are doing this so that they can specifically target people who can qualify for loans and reach out to them quickly. Input data needs to be pre-processed before we feed it to the model as well. For example, imputing missing values. Another challenge would be creating different classifiers to test prediction accuracy.
Variables:
Loan_ID, Gender, Marital Status, Number of Dependents, Education, Self_Employed, ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome, LoanAmount, Loan_amount_term, Credit_history, Property_Area, Loan_status.
Technique:
●	 Scikit-Learn
●	  Python Pandas
●	  SQL Database
●	  JavaScript Plotly
 Process:
●	    Encoding Categorical Features
●	    Data Cleaning
●	    Remove or imputing missing values
●	    Training/Testing Data
●	    Comparing DecisionTreeClassifier and RandomForestClassifier
●	     Predicition
Predictive Analytics:
In this analysis, we will generate a linear or logistic regression to identify the customers segments, those are eligible for loan amount so that we can specifically target customers with different variables.
